    <p> <span style= 'color: red;' > hoisting in JS  </span> = it is a phenomena by hich wee can access the function and variable before defining it  </p>

    <h1>Undefined  -  its just like a placeholder till the value is not defined to the variable</h1>

    <h1>JS is loosly type langauage i.e is does not attached its variable to any specific datatypes</h1>

        lexical environment is the local memory and the reference to the  lexical environment of its paresnt <br>
         here we can say that function c() is  <span style="color: blue; border: 2px solid black;  " >Lexically</span> sitting inside function a() or we can say that in order  or in hearachi
         <br> or also we can say that the code physically present in the code 
         <hr>
         so lexical parent of fumction c() is function a()
         <br>i.e  c() function will have access of lexical environment of a() also
         <hr>
         just as a() is   <span style="color: blue; border: 2px solid black;  " >Lexically</span> inside global scope
         <br>
         lexical parent of fumction a() is global
 <hr>
         <br>i.e  a() function will have access of lexical environment of global also
        <br>
        the whole chain of lexical environment is called  as scope chain , its describe the wheather the a variable or function is inside the scope or not
