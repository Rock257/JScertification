3. why we used Docktypein html  -  to tell the browser which version of html we are using
4. wht is use head tag - include meta tag use for sco ,external links , title of document 
5. better place of script file in hlml file - just before the closing tag
can use in head tag also with attribute(differ) in script file which tells the executer hold script and execute after html ready in DOM

6. whats is display VALUE OF /type of randomly cretaed element  - Inline(b default element )

7.diff. in inline and block 
can't give witdh and height to inline ,margin can be given L, R not in Top/bottom  ,paddin can be given 
can give witdh and height ,margin also and every elemnt start from new line

8.image and video are both inline elm still we can give width and height -both are come from <b>Replace inline element  </b> these are come from some sources
<b>non Replace inline element can't  - like span ,anchor like </b>
